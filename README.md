What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The main problem I was solving in these projects for this course were understanding, as well as applyting data structures and algorithms to perform in their intended means. In project one, I analyzed differend data structures. In project two, I applied my knowledge of data structuresd and algorithms to organize and display course information.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by breaking everything down into small steps that make sense in my head as well for code building. It took me the most time to understand arrays, linked lists, and hash tables, but gained an understanding through online research and video watching.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by giving myself enough time after I hit them to be able to think it over in my head and do research online to find a solution. By using online resources, it allowed me to identify and finally correct errors in my code.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and devloping programs by being able to think about development in terms of efficiency and program stability. I now will think about what data structures will be the most effective based on memory needs, speed, and user needs.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
These projects eveolved the way I write programs that are maintanable, readable, and adaptable. I will use more descriptive names for methods and cunctions, while still insuring they are reusable. Also, using algorithms appropriately will help me use functions to execute tasks more efficiently.
